				<p> My name is Dan. I began my undergraduate education studying biochemistry.
				 I took an introductory computer science course during the first semester of 
				 my junior year. I enjoyed it, and now I'm pursuing a minor in computer science.
				 In my free time, I like to do things. I would like to maybe have more things
				 in this paragraph later, though I won't do it now!</p>
