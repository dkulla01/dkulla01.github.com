COMP20 HW1
README.txt

For this assignment, I implemented 3 websites. For the computer_format_2
(i.e. the CSS for when the webpages are viewed a computer screen), I made a 
panel of links that allows users to navigate through the pages. This 
panel was not implemented as well in the handheld CSS (I would have worked
more on it if I had more time.)

The layout of the handheld site could be a little better. I used the chrome
developer tools extensively to tweak the sizes of things for the
computer_format_2 CSS, but I couldn't find a comprable tool for handheld
devices. Thus, to verify changes with the handheld CSS, I had to git add,
git commit, and git push instead of just being able to live-edit in chrome.

I spent approximately 3 hours on this assignment.

I discussed github use with Gabe Nicholas.
